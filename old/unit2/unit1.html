<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm a book designer living in Brooklyn. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I want to expand my mostly-print portfolio and skill set.</p>

<br>

<h2>My mission</h2>

<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as the lead designer at a small studio that my web designer husband and I will establish because I'd like us to work together, for clients we care about, in a place we've built.</p>
